# Educational Platform API

## Overview

This project is a backend API built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) for an educational platform with role-based functionalities. The platform supports three primary roles—Admin, Teacher, and Student—each with specific access controls and API endpoints. The backend is designed to manage content, user interactions, and real-time communication in a multilingual environment, with PostgreSQL as the database.
## Features

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Provides Admin, Teacher, and Student roles with distinct access levels.

Content Management: Multilingual content creation, management, and access.
Analytics and Reporting: Admin-level analytics to track user engagement and course completion.

Class Scheduling and Lesson Management: Teacher tools for organizing classes, monitoring students, and assigning tasks.

Student Interaction: Real-time interaction options for students, including live classes, Q&A, and personalized progress tracking.

### Key Components
- *config/: Contains Django settings and environment configurations.
- *nativo_english/*: Houses all role-specific apps (Admin, Teacher, Student) with separated views and serializers for each.
shared/: Models and utilities shared across roles (e.g., User model, permissions, authentication).
tests/: Unit and integration tests for each role and endpoint.
API Documentation
Each role has designated endpoints for specific functionalities:

## Admin APIs

**User Management**: Create, update, and delete user accounts.

**Content Management**: Manage lesson content in multiple languages.
Analytics & Reporting: View engagement and course completion analytics.
Teacher APIs

**Class Scheduling**: Schedule and update class information.

**Lesson Management**: Upload and modify lessons.

**Student Monitoring**: Monitor progress, assign tasks, and give feedback.
Student APIs

**Content Access**: Access lessons and quizzes.

**Progress Tracking**: Track personal progress.

**Real-Time Interactions**: Join live classes, interact with teachers.

For a detailed API schema, refer to the auto-generated documentation (available after running the project) at /docs (Will add Swagger link here)
